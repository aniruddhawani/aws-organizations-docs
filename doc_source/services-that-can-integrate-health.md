# AWS Health and AWS Organizations<a name="services-that-can-integrate-health"></a>

AWS Health provides ongoing visibility into your resource performance and the availability of your AWS services and accounts\. AWS Health delivers events when your AWS resources and services are impacted by an issue or will be affected by upcoming changes\. After you enable organizational view, a user in the organization’s management account can aggregate AWS Health events across all accounts in the organization\. Organizational view only shows AWS Health events delivered after the feature is enabled and retains them for 90 days\. 

You can enable organizational view by using the AWS Health console, the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), or the AWS Health API\. 

For more information, see [Aggregating AWS Health events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html) in the *AWS Health User Guide*\.

Use the following information to help you integrate AWS Health with AWS Organizations\.



## Service\-linked roles created when you enable integration<a name="integrate-enable-slr-health"></a>

The following [service\-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) is automatically created in your organization's management account when you enable trusted access\. This role allows AWS Health to perform supported operations within your organization's accounts in your organization\.

You can delete or modify this role only if you disable trusted access between AWS Health and Organizations, or if you remove the member account from the organization\.
