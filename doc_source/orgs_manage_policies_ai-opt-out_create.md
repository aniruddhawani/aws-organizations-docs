# Creating, updating, and deleting AI services opt\-out policies<a name="orgs_manage_policies_ai-opt-out_create"></a>

**In this topic:**
+ After you [enable AI service opt\-out policies](orgs_manage_policies_enable-disable.md#enable-policy-type) for your organization, you can [create a policy](#create-ai-opt-out-policy-procedure)\.
+ When your opt\-out requirements change, you can [update an existing policy](#update-ai-opt-out-policy-procedure)\.
+ When you no longer need a policy and after you detach it from all organizational units \(OUs\) and accounts, you can [delete it](#delete-ai-opt-out-policy-procedure)\.

## Creating an AI services opt\-out policy<a name="create-ai-opt-out-policy-procedure"></a>

**Minimum permissions**  
To create an AI services opt\-out policy, you need permission to run the following action:  
`organizations:CreatePolicy`

------
#### [ AWS Management Console ]

**To create an AI services opt\-out policy**

1. Sign in to the [AWS Organizations console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2)\. You must sign in as an IAM user, assume an IAM role, or sign in as the root user \([not recommended](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#lock-away-credentials)\) in the organization’s management account\.

1. On the **[AI services opt\-out policies](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2/home/policies/aiservices-opt-out-policy)** page, choose **Create policy**\. 

1. On the [**Create new AI services opt\-out policy** page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2/home/policies/aiservices-opt-out-policy/create), enter a **Policy name** and an optional **Policy description**\.

1. \(Optional\) You can add one or more tags to the policy by choosing **Add tag** and then entering a key and an optional value\. Leaving the value blank sets it to an empty string; it isn't `null`\. You can attach up to 50 tags to a policy\. For more information, see [Tagging AWS Organizations resources](orgs_tagging.md)\.

1. Enter or paste the policy text in the **JSON** tab\. For information about AI services opt\-out policy syntax, see [AI services opt\-out policy syntax and examples](orgs_manage_policies_ai-opt-out_syntax.md)\. For example policies that you can use as a starting point, see [AI services opt\-out policy examples](orgs_manage_policies_ai-opt-out_syntax.md#ai-opt-out-policy-examples)\.

1. When you're finished editing your policy, choose **Create policy** at the lower\-right corner of the page\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI & AWS SDKs ]

**To create an AI services opt\-out policy**  
You can use one of the following to create a tag policy:
+ AWS CLI: [create\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/organizations/create-policy.html)

  1. Create an AI services opt\-out policy like the following, and store it in a text file\. Note that "`optOut`" and "`optIn`" are case\-sensitive\.

     ```
     {
         "services": {
             "default": {
                 "opt_out_policy": {
                     "@@assign": "optOut"
                 }
             },
             "rekognition": {
                 "opt_out_policy": {
                     "@@assign": "optIn"
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

     This AI services opt\-out policy specifies that all accounts affected by the policy are opted out of all AI services except for Amazon Rekognition\. 

  1. Import the JSON policy file to create a new policy in the organization\. In this example, the previous JSON file was named `policy.json`\.

     ```
     $ aws organizations create-policy \
         --type AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY \
         --name "MyTestPolicy" \
         --description "My test policy" \
         --content file://policy.json
     {
         "Policy": {
             "Content": "{\"services\":{\"default\":{\"opt_out_policy\":{\"@@assign\":\"optOut\"}},\"rekognition\":{\"opt_out_policy\":{\"@@assign\":\"optIn\"}}}}",
             "PolicySummary": {
                 "Id": "p-i9j8k7l6m5"
                 "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::o-aa111bb222:policy/aiservices_opt_out_policy/p-i9j8k7l6m5",
                 "Description": "My test policy",
                 "Name": "MyTestPolicy",
                 "Type": "AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY"
             }
         }
     }
     ```
+ AWS SDKs: [CreatePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_CreatePolicy.html)

------

**What to do next**  
After you create an AI services opt\-out policy, you can put your opt\-out choices into effect\. To do that, you can [attach the policy](attach-tag-policy.md) to the organization root, organizational units \(OUs\), AWS accounts within your organization, or a combination of all of those\. 

## Updating an AI services opt\-out policy<a name="update-ai-opt-out-policy-procedure"></a>

**Minimum permissions**  
To update an AI services opt\-out policy, you must have permission to run the following actions:  
`organizations:UpdatePolicy` with a `Resource` element in the same policy statement that includes the ARN of the specified policy \(or "\*"\)
`organizations:DescribePolicy` with a `Resource` element in the same policy statement that includes the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the specified policy \(or "\*"\)

------
#### [ AWS Management Console ]

**To update an AI services opt\-out policy**

1. Sign in to the [AWS Organizations console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2)\. You must sign in as an IAM user, assume an IAM role, or sign in as the root user \([not recommended](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#lock-away-credentials)\) in the organization’s management account\.

1. On the **[AI services opt\-out policies](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2/home/policies/aiservices-opt-out-policy)** page, choose the name of the policy that you want to update\.

1. On the policy's detail page, choose **Edit policy**\.

1. You can enter a new **Policy name**, **Policy description**, or edit the **JSON** policy text\. For information about AI services opt\-out policy syntax, see [AI services opt\-out policy syntax and examples](orgs_manage_policies_ai-opt-out_syntax.md)\.

1. When you're finished updating the policy, choose **Save changes**\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI & AWS SDKs ]

**To update a policy**  
You can use one of the following to update a policy: 
+ AWS CLI: [update\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/organizations/update-policy.html)

  The following example renames an AI services opt\-out policy\.

  ```
  $ aws organizations update-policy \
      --policy-id p-i9j8k7l6m5 \
      --name "Renamed policy"
  {
      "Policy": {
          "PolicySummary": {
              "Id": "p-i9j8k7l6m5",
              "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:policy/o-aa111bb222/aiservices_opt_out_policy/p-i9j8k7l6m5",
              "Name": "Renamed policy",
              "Type": "AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY",
              "AwsManaged": false
          },
          "Content": "{\"services\":{\"default\":{\"opt_out_policy\":   ....TRUNCATED FOR BREVITY...   :{\"@@assign\":\"optIn\"}}}}"
      }
  }
  ```

  The following example adds or changes the description for an AI services opt\-out policy\.

  ```
  $ aws organizations update-policy \
      --policy-id p-i9j8k7l6m5 \
      --description "My new description"
  {
      "Policy": {
          "PolicySummary": {
              "Id": "p-i9j8k7l6m5",
              "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:policy/o-aa111bb222/aiservices_opt_out_policy/p-i9j8k7l6m5",
              "Name": "Renamed policy",
              "Description": "My new description",
              "Type": "AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY",
              "AwsManaged": false
          },
          "Content": "{\"services\":{\"default\":{\"opt_out_policy\":   ....TRUNCATED FOR BREVITY...   :{\"@@assign\":\"optIn\"}}}}"
      }
  }
  ```

  The following example changes the JSON policy document attached to an AI services opt\-out policy\. In this example, the content is taken from a file called `policy.json` with the following text:

  ```
  {
      "services": {
          "default": {
              "opt_out_policy": {
                  "@@assign": "optOut"
              }
          },
          "comprehend": {
              "opt_out_policy": {
                  "@@operators_allowed_for_child_policies": ["@@none"],
                  "@@assign": "optOut"
              }
          },
          "rekognition": {
              "opt_out_policy": {
                  "@@assign": "optIn"
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  ```
  $ aws organizations update-policy \
      --policy-id p-i9j8k7l6m5 \
      --content file://policy.json
  {
      "Policy": {
          "PolicySummary": {
              "Id": "p-i9j8k7l6m5",
              "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:policy/o-aa111bb222/aiservices_opt_out_policy/p-i9j8k7l6m5",
