# AWS Backup and AWS Organizations<a name="services-that-can-integrate-backup"></a>

AWS Backup is a service that allows you to manage and monitor the AWS Backup jobs in your organization\. Using AWS Backup, if you sign\-in as a user in the organization's management account, you can enable organization\-wide backup protection and monitoring\. It helps you to achieve compliance by using [backup policies](orgs_manage_policies_backup.md) to centrally apply AWS Backup plans to resources across all of the accounts in your organization\. When you use both AWS Backup and AWS Organizations together, you can get the following benefits:

**Protection**  
You can [enable the backup policy type](orgs_manage_policies_enable-disable.md) in your organization and then [create backup policies](orgs_manage_policies_backup_create.md) to attach to the organization's root, OUs, or accounts\. A backup policy combines an AWS Backup plan with the other details required to apply the plan automatically to your accounts\.Policies that are directly attached to an account are merged with policies [inherited](orgs_manage_policies_inheritance_mgmt.md) from the organization's root and any parent OUs to create an [effective policy](orgs_manage_policies_backup_effective.md) that applies to the account\. The policy includes the ID of an IAM role that has permissions to run AWS Backup on the resources in your accounts\. AWS Backup uses the IAM role to perform the backup on your behalf as specified by the backup plan in the effective policy\.

**Monitoring**  
When you [enable trusted access for AWS Backup](orgs_integrate_services.md#orgs_how-to-enable-disable-trusted-access) in your organization, you can use the AWS Backup console to view details about the backup, restore, and copy jobs in any of the accounts in your organization\. For more information, see [Monitor your backup jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/monitor-and-verify-protected-resources.html) in the *AWS Backup Developer Guide*\.

For more information about AWS Backup, see the *[AWS Backup Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/)*\.

Use the following information to help you integrate AWS Backup with AWS Organizations\.



## Enabling trusted access with AWS Backup<a name="integrate-enable-ta-backup"></a>

For information about the permissions needed to enable trusted access, see [Permissions required to enable trusted access](orgs_integrate_services.md#orgs_trusted_access_perms)\.

You can enable trusted access using either the AWS Backup console or the AWS Organizations console\.

**Important**  
We strongly recommend that whenever possible, you use the AWS Backup console or tools to enable integration with Organizations\. This lets AWS Backup perform any configuration that it requires, such as creating resources needed by the service\. Proceed with these steps only if you can’t enable integration using the tools provided by AWS Backup\. For more information, see [this note](orgs_integrate_services.md#important-note-about-integration)\.   
If you enable trusted access by using the AWS Backup console or tools then you don’t need to complete these steps\.

To enabled trusted access using AWS Backup, see [Enabling backup in multiple AWS accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/manage-cross-account.html#enable-xaccount-management) in the *AWS Backup Developer Guide*\.

## Disabling trusted access with AWS Backup<a name="integrate-disable-ta-backup"></a>

For information about the permissions needed to enable trusted access, see [Permissions required to enable trusted access](orgs_integrate_services.md#orgs_trusted_access_perms)\.

AWS Backup requires trusted access with AWS Organizations to enable monitoring of backup, restore, and copy jobs across your organization's accounts\. If you disable trusted access AWS Backup, you lose the ability to view jobs outside of the current account\. The AWS Backup role that AWS Backup creates remains\. If you later re\-enable trusted access, AWS Backup continues to operate as before, without the need for you to reconfigure the service\. 

You can disable trusted access using only the Organizations tools\.

You can disable trusted access by running a Organizations AWS CLI command, or by calling an Organizations API operation in one of the AWS SDKs\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI, AWS API ]

**To disable trusted service access using the Organizations CLI/SDK**  
You can use the following AWS CLI commands or API operations to disable trusted service access:
+ AWS CLI: [disable\-aws\-service\-access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/organizations/disable-aws-service-access.html)

  You can run the following command to disable AWS Backup as a trusted service with Organizations\.

  ```
  $ aws organizations disable-aws-service-access \
      --service-principal backup.amazonaws.com
  ```

  This command produces no output when successful\.
+ AWS API: [DisableAWSServiceAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_DisableAWSServiceAccess.html)
