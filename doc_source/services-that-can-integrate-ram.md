# AWS Resource Access Manager and AWS Organizations<a name="services-that-can-integrate-ram"></a>

AWS Resource Access Manager \(AWS RAM\) enables you to share specified AWS resources that you own with other AWS accounts\. It's a centralized service that provides a consistent experience for sharing different types of AWS resources across multiple accounts\.

For more information about AWS RAM, see the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html)\.

Use the following information to help you integrate AWS Resource Access Manager with AWS Organizations\.



## Service\-linked roles created when you enable integration<a name="integrate-enable-slr-ram"></a>

The following [service\-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) is automatically created in your organization's management account when you enable trusted access\. This role allows AWS RAM to perform supported operations within your organization's accounts in your organization\.

You can delete or modify this role only if you disable trusted access between AWS RAM and Organizations, or if you remove the member account from the organization\.
+ `AWSServiceRoleForResourceAccessManager`

## Service principals used by the service\-linked roles<a name="integrate-enable-svcprin-ram"></a>

The service\-linked role in the previous section can be assumed only by the service principals authorized by the trust relationships defined for the role\. The service\-linked roles used by AWS RAM grant access to the following service principals:
+ `ram.amazonaws.com`

For information about the permissions needed to enable trusted access, see [Permissions required to enable trusted access](orgs_integrate_services.md#orgs_trusted_access_perms)\.

You can enable trusted access using either the AWS Resource Access Manager console or the AWS Organizations console\.

**Important**  
We strongly recommend that whenever possible, you use the AWS Resource Access Manager console or tools to enable integration with Organizations\. This lets AWS Resource Access Manager perform any configuration that it requires, such as creating resources needed by the service\. Proceed with these steps only if you can’t enable integration using the tools provided by AWS Resource Access Manager\. For more information, see [this note](orgs_integrate_services.md#important-note-about-integration)\.   
If you enable trusted access by using the AWS Resource Access Manager console or tools then you don’t need to complete these steps\.

**To enable trusted access using the AWS RAM console or CLI**  
See [Enable Sharing with AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.html#getting-started-sharing-orgs) in the *AWS RAM User Guide*\.

You can enable trusted access by using either the AWS Organizations console, by running a AWS CLI command, or by calling an API operation in one of the AWS SDKs\.

------
#### [ AWS Management Console ]

**To enable trusted service access using the Organizations console**

1. Sign in to the [AWS Organizations console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2)\. You must sign in as an IAM user, assume an IAM role, or sign in as the root user \([not recommended](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#lock-away-credentials)\) in the organization’s management account\.

1. On the **[Services](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2/home/services)** page, find the row for **AWS Resource Access Manager**, choose the service’s name, and then choose **Enable trusted access**\.

1. In the confirmation dialog box, enable **Show the option to enable trusted access**, enter **enable** in the box, and then choose **Enable trusted access**\.

1. If you are the administrator of only AWS Organizations, tell the administrator of AWS Resource Access Manager that they can now enable that service using its console to work with AWS Organizations\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI, AWS API ]

**To enable trusted service access using the OrganizationsCLI/SDK**  
You can use the following AWS CLI commands or API operations to enable trusted service access:
+ AWS CLI: [enable\-aws\-service\-access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/organizations/enable-aws-service-access.html)

  You can run the following command to enable AWS Resource Access Manager as a trusted service with Organizations\.

  ```
  $ aws organizations enable-aws-service-access \ 
      --service-principal ram.amazonaws.com
  ```

  This command produces no output when successful\.
