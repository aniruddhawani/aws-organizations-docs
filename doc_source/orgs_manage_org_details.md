To view the details of an organization, you must have the following permission:  
`organizations:DescribeOrganization`

------
#### [ AWS Management Console ]

**To view the details for your organization**

1. Sign in to the [AWS Organizations console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2)\. You must sign in as an IAM user, assume an IAM role, or sign in as the root user \([not recommended](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#lock-away-credentials)\) in the organization’s management account\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI & AWS SDKs ]

**To view the details for your organization**  
You can use one of the following commands to view details of an organization:
+ AWS CLI: [describe\-organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/organizations/describe-organization.html) 

  The following example shows the information included in the output of this command\.

  ```
  $ aws organizations describe-organization
  {
      "Organization": {
          "Id": "o-aa111bb222",
          "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:organization/o-aa111bb222",
          "FeatureSet": "ALL",
          "MasterAccountArn": "arn:aws:organizations::128716708097:account/o-aa111bb222/123456789012",

  The following example shows how to retrieve the details of the root, including which policy types are currently enabled in the organization:

  ```
  $ aws organizations list-roots
  {
      "Roots": [
          {
              "Id": "r-a1b2",
              "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:root/o-aa111bb222/r-a1b2",

## Viewing the details of an OU<a name="orgs_view_ou"></a>

------
#### [ AWS Management Console ]<a name="view_details_ou_v2"></a>

**To view details of an OU**

1. Sign in to the [AWS Organizations console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2)\. You must sign in as an IAM user, assume an IAM role, or sign in as the root user \([not recommended](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#lock-away-credentials)\) in the organization’s management account\.

1. On the **[AWS accounts](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2/home/accounts)** page, choose the name of the OU \(not its radio button\) that you want to examine\. If the OU that you want is a child of another OU, choose the triangle icon next to its parent OU to expand it and see those in the next level of the hierarchy\. Repeat until you find the OU that you want\.

   The **Organizational unit details** box shows the information about the OU\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI & AWS SDKs ]

**To view details of an OU**  
You can use the following commands to view details of an OU:

  + [list\-children](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/organizations/list-children.html) 
  + [describe\-organizational\-unit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/organizations/describe-organizational-unit.html) 

  The following example shows how to find the ID of on OU using the AWS CLI\. You find the OU ID by traversing the hierarchy starting with the `list-roots` command and then performing `list-children` on the root and iteratively on each of its children until you find the one you want\.

  ```
  $ aws organizations list-roots
  {
      "Roots": [
          {
              "Id": "r-a1b2",
              "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:root/o-aa111bb222/r-a1b2",
              "Name": "Root",
              "PolicyTypes": []
          }
      ]
  }
  $ aws organizations list-children --parent-id r-a1b2 --child-type ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT
  {
      "Children": [
          {
              "Id": "ou-a1b2-f6g7h111",
              "Type": "ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

  After you have the OU's ID, the following example shows how to retrieve the details about the OU\.

  ```
  $ aws organizations describe-organizational-unit --organizational-unit-id ou-a1b2-f6g7h111
  {
      "OrganizationalUnit": {
          "Id": "ou-a1b2-f6g7h111",
          "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:ou/o-aa111bb222/ou-a1b2-f6g7h111",
          "Name": "Production-Apps"
      }
  }
  ```
