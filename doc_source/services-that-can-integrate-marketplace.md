# AWS Marketplace and AWS Organizations<a name="services-that-can-integrate-marketplace"></a>

AWS Marketplace is a curated digital catalog that you can use to find, buy, deploy, and manage third\-party software, data, and services that you need to build solutions and run your businesses\.

AWS Marketplace creates and manages licenses using AWS License Manager for your purchases in AWS Marketplace\. When you share \(grant access to\) your licenses with other accounts in your organization, AWS Marketplace creates and manages new licenses for those accounts\. 

For more information, see [Service\-linked roles for AWS Marketplace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/buyer-using-service-linked-roles.html) in the *AWS Marketplace Buyer Guide*\.

Use the following information to help you integrate AWS Marketplace with AWS Organizations\.



## Service\-linked roles created when you enable integration<a name="integrate-enable-slr-marketplace"></a>

The following [service\-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) is automatically created in your organization's management account when you enable trusted access\.

You can delete or modify this role only if you disable trusted access between AWS Marketplace and Organizations, or if you remove the member account from the organization\.

You can enable trusted access using either the AWS Marketplace console or the AWS Organizations console\.

**Important**  
We strongly recommend that whenever possible, you use the AWS Marketplace console or tools to enable integration with Organizations\. This lets AWS Marketplace perform any configuration that it requires, such as creating resources needed by the service\. Proceed with these steps only if you can’t enable integration using the tools provided by AWS Marketplace\. For more information, see [this note](orgs_integrate_services.md#important-note-about-integration)\.   
If you enable trusted access by using the AWS Marketplace console or tools then you don’t need to complete these steps\.
