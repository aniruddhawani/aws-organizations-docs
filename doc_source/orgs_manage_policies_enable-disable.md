## Disabling a policy type<a name="disable-policy-type"></a>

If you no longer want to use a certain policy type in your organization, you can disable that type to prevent its accidental use\. You can disable a policy type from only the organization's management account\.

**Important**  
When you disable a policy type, all policies of the specified type are automatically detached from all entities in the organization root\. The policies are ***not*** deleted\.
\(Service control policy type only\) If you re\-enable the SCP policy type later, all entities in the organization root are initially attached to only the default `FullAWSAccess` SCP\. Attachments of SCPs to entities are lost when the SCPs are disabled in the organization\. If you later want to re\-enable SCPs, you must reattach them to the organization's root, OUs, and accounts, as appropriate\.

**Minimum permissions**  
To disable SCPs, you need permission to run the following actions:  
`organizations:DisablePolicyType`
`organizations:DescribeOrganization` – required only when using the Organizations console
`organizations:ListRoots` – required only when using the Organizations console
