**Minimum permissions**  
To list the policies within your organization, you must have the following permission:

You can view the policies in your organization in the AWS Management Console or by using an AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) command or an AWS SDK operation\.

1. Sign in to the [AWS Organizations console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2)\. You must sign in as an IAM user, assume an IAM role, or sign in as the root user \([not recommended](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#lock-away-credentials)\) in the organization’s management account\.

1. On the **[Policies](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2/home/policies)** page, choose the policy type that you want to list\.

   If the specified policy type is enabled, the console displays a list of all of the policies of that type that are currently available in the organization\.
